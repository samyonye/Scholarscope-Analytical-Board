Introduction:
This report presents a technical analysis of data from the Scholarscope Analytical Board, which covers 1,000 students. The analysis explores the relationship between academic performance and key variables such as gender, study and social media habits, parental education, part-time job status, and diet quality. The purpose is to uncover trends and correlations that can guide educational institutions and policymakers in improving student outcomes.

Story of the Data:
The Scholarscope data reveals the academic and lifestyle patterns of 1,000 students. On average, students scored 69.60 in exams, studied 3.55 hours/day, and spent 2.51 hours/day on social media. Interestingly, those whose parents had a high school or bachelor's education performed better academically and used social media more than others.
Female students studied slightly more and had higher scores than males, while students doing part-time jobs had lower attendance rates, suggesting a negative impact on academic consistency.
Importantly, diet quality strongly influenced mental health - students with fair or good diets reported better well-being, while those with poor diets had the lowest mental health ratings.
In essence, the data highlights how parental background, gender, employment, and lifestyle choices influence both academic performance and mental wellness.

DATA SPLITTING AND PREPROCESSING
DATA CLEANING: this is when the data is free from errors dataset ensures accuracy and reliability in analysis and which include;
Removing duplicates
Correcting errors
Standardizing data format
Data Transformations: Transformations were applied to prepare the data for better interpretation and analysis.
Data splitting: This involve the splitting of data point into two category independent and dependent variable.
· Independent variable are those variable that can stand alone i.e your name, and can still make meaning.
· Dependent variable are those variable that can't stand alone they won't make any meaning until they are attached to something e.g revenue, quantity.

Potential analysis/ Insight
1 Does studying more hours lead to higher exam scores?
2 How does sleep affect performance?
3 Which habits have the strongest impact on academic success?
4 Does screen time negatively impact performance?
5 Do students with part-time jobs perform worse academically?
6 How does mental health impact exam results?

Potential Insight
1 Students studying 3–5 hours/day tend to have the highest scores.
2 Students sleeping 6–8 hours generally perform better
3 Moderate screen time (1–3 hrs/day) has less impact, possibly due to relaxation benefits.
4 Students with part-time jobs score slightly lower on average
5 Students with higher mental health scores (8–10) tend to have much better academic results.

In analysis observation
Study Hours Range Widely: Students study from 0 to 12+ hours/day.
Social Media Usage: Generally moderate, averaging ~2–4 hours/day.
Sleep Patterns Vary: From under 5 hours to over 9 hours.
Part-Time Jobs: A notable portion of students hold part-time jobs.
Diet Quality: Categorized as "Poor", "Fair", or "Good" - diversely spread.
Exercise Frequency: Ranges from no exercise to regular weekly activity.
Mental Health Ratings: Rated from 1 (low) to 10 (high).
Exam Scores: Vary from ~25 to 100.

In analysis Insight
1. Higher Study Hours → Better Exam Scores: A visible positive correlation exists.
2. Excessive Social Media & Netflix Time → Lower Exam Scores: Suggests distraction or time mismanagement.
3. Poor Sleep (≤5 hrs) Correlates with Lower Scores: Indicates cognitive performance may suffer with inadequate rest.
4. Balanced Lifestyle (Good Diet + Exercise) → Better Mental Health and Scores: Suggests holistic habits matter.
5. Part-Time Job Holders Tend to Study Less: Possibly due to time constraints - often correlates with slightly lower academic performance.
6. Extracurricular Participation → Slight Boost in Mental Health & Attendance: Suggests social/physical activities help.
7. Parental Education Level & Internet Quality: Higher levels correlate with better academic outcomes.

OBSERVATION
1. Study Habits Strongly Predict Performance
 Students who dedicate more hours to studying tend to score significantly higher on exams.

2. Distractions Negatively Affect Academic Outcomes
 High usage of social media and streaming platforms correlates with lower exam scores.

3.  Sleep is a Key Factor in Performance
 Students sleeping 7–8 hours tend to perform better than those sleeping less than 6 hours.

4. Lifestyle Quality Matters
  Good diet and frequent exercise are associated with better mental health and academic scores.

5. Part-Time Jobs Present a Trade-Off
Students with part-time jobs often have lower study hours and moderately reduced academic performance.

6. Parental Support and Environment Influence Success
Higher parental education and good internet quality are associated with better exam outcomes.

7. Extracurricular Involvement Enhances Well-being
Linked to better mental health and slightly improved attendance, though academic effects are neutral or slightly positive.

RECOMMENDATION
1. Prioritize Study Time
Aim for at least 2–3 hours of focused study per day to improve academic results.

2. Limit Digital Distractions
Cap social media and streaming time to 1–2 hours daily, especially on weekdays.

3. Maintain a Consistent Sleep Schedule
Ensure 7–8 hours of sleep to enhance memory retention and focus.

4. Adopt Healthy Lifestyle Habits
Incorporate regular exercise and a balanced diet to boost energy, mood, and performance.

5. Balance Work and Study
If holding a part-time job, consider reducing hours during exam periods or using time-management techniques to stay on track.

6. Promote Digital Wellness
Run workshops or sessions on managing screen time and improving focus.

7. Support Mental Health
Provide accessible counseling services and stress management programs.

8. Encourage Healthy Routines
Offer physical activity programs, healthy meals, and wellness initiatives on campus.

9. Provide Flexible Academic Support
Design flexible learning options or tutoring support for working students.

10. Strengthen Parental Engagement
Educate parents on the impact of their support and how to create an enabling learning environment at home.

Conclusion
The analytical insights from the Scholarscope dashboard show clear patterns:
Gender: Female students slightly outperform others academically, supported by marginally higher study hours.
Parental Education: Moderate parental education levels (high school/bachelor) correlate with better student performance.
Social Media Use: Students with higher parental education spend less time on social media.
Part-Time Jobs: Negatively impact attendance.
Diet Quality: Strongly linked to mental health outcomes.
